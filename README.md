# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- The purpose of this analysis was the ability to organize and query data, especially on a large scale, working through a large chunk of data modeling! Understanding the data, we're working with and finding the connections within a huge step and following the data from one table to another applying the knowledge of Data Frames and tabular data, and create entity relationship diagrams, importing data into a database, troubleshooting common errors, and create queries that use data to answer questions applying the most widely used query languages SQL Postgres PgAdmin to predict the retirement of is numerous employees at the Pawlett Hacked company. This was accomplished by analyzing an employee database and establishing the number of retiring employees by each job title and identifying employees who qualify to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results:
